# LocaSense ‚Äì Intelligent Bluetooth Tracking System

LocaSense is a prototype of a low-energy Bluetooth-based personal tracking system designed to help users recover lost belongings in real-time. It uses a small ESP32-based device that broadcasts a unique ID when disconnected from the user. If another Bluetooth-enabled device detects it, the device's location is uploaded to a central server and relayed back to the owner's app.

## üîç Abstract

This project presents a prototype for LocaSense, a personal tracking system designed to aid users in recovering lost belongings. LocaSense utilizes Bluetooth technology to provide a simple and efficient solution for locating misplaced items. Each user pairs a small, low-power device with their account, which broadcasts a unique ID when triggered. When detected by another Bluetooth device, the lost item's location is sent to a server and shared with the original user.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a working prototype using BLE
- Enable item tracking via central server
- Minimize power usage using ESP32 low-power modes
- Ensure data privacy and encryption
- Simulate real-world scenarios of item recovery

## üîß Tools & Technologies

- **Hardware**: ESP32, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Firebase/MQTT for backend (optional), React Native (for mobile app prototype)
- **Protocols**: BLE Advertising, GATT
- **Security**: Basic ID obfuscation
