# **App Name**: LocaFind

## Core Features:

- Informative Landing Page: Landing page with clear explanation of LocaFind and its benefits.
- User ID Management: Allow users to generate and manage unique user IDs for their LocaSense devices.
- Location Display: Display the last known location of the user's lost item on a simple map. (Simulated)
- Simulated Alert Trigger: Provide a simple UI element to trigger a 'lost item' alert, simulating the ESP32 broadcast.
- Location Confidence Estimation: Use an AI tool to estimate the confidence of the location, based on simulated signal strength.
- Bluetooth Device Finding: Implement a 'Find My Device' feature similar to Jio Tag or AirTag, utilizing Bluetooth to locate devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to convey a sense of security and reliability.
- Secondary color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) for neutral backgrounds and text.
- Accent: Orange (#FFA500) for highlighting the location on the map and interactive elements.
- Clean and simple layout with a focus on the map display.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for items, locations, and alerts.

## Original User Request:
an app that integrate my esp 32 to find the lost device and here is the abstract This project presents a prototype for LocaSense, a personal tracking system designed to aid 
users in recovering lost belongings.  LocaSense utilizes Bluetooth technology to provide a 
simple and efficient solution for locating misplaced items.  Each user pairs a small, low-power 
LocaSense device with their account, generating a unique user ID.  This device is then attached 
to personal items such as bags, keys, or phones.  In the event of loss, the LocaSense device 
initiates a broadcast of the user's unique ID upon detecting nearby Bluetooth signals.  When 
another Bluetooth-enabled device connects to the LocaSense device, the location of the lost 
item, along with the user's ID, is transmitted to a central server.  This server then relays the 
location information to the user's account, providing a means to pinpoint the lost item's 
location. This prototype focuses on the core functionality of LocaSense, demonstrating the 
pairing process, ID generation, Bluetooth-based location detection, and data transmission to a 
simulated server environment.  The project explores the feasibility of this approach, addressing 
key challenges such as power consumption, range limitations, and data security.  While this 
prototype represents an initial implementation, it lays the groundwork for a more 
comprehensive and robust personal tracking system.  Future development could include 
enhanced security features, improved location accuracy, and integration with mapping services 
for seamless location visualization.
